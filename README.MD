This Flask application allows you to download and play YouTube videos sequentially. It manages a video queue, displays search results on a separate page, and updates the queue with new items while playing. The application also displays the title of the next video before it is downloaded.

it will install required dependancies if not found.

on first encounter of a age restricted video you will need to follow the instructions output to console. but after that it won't be needed.
