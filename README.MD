# YouTube Player Application

This Flask application allows you to and play YouTube videos sequentially. It manages a video queue, displays search results on a separate page, and updates the queue with new items while playing. The application also displays the title of the next video before it is played.


run using `python3 ./player.py'

first run it will ask in console for you to authenticate

this will only happen the first time you run. it's to bypass age restrictions.

it will ask for a new one when you encounter an age restricted video if the token changes though.

this is only until i figure out an age bypass.

it will install required dependancies if not found.
